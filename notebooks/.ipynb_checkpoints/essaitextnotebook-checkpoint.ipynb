Addressing it requires a multidisciplinary effort to define the nature and extent of the \\nproblem, detect fake news in real time, and mitigate its potentially harmful effects. This will \\nrequire a better understanding of how the Internet spreads content, how people process news, and \\nhow the two interact.  We review the state of knowledge in these areas and discuss two broad \\npotential mitigation strategies: better enabling individuals to identify fake news, and intervention \\nwithin the platforms to reduce the attention given to fake news. The cooperation of Internet \\nplatforms (especially Facebook, Google, and Twitter) with researchers will be critical to \\nunderstanding the scale of the issue and the effectiveness of possible interventions. \\n \\nMain Text: \\n \\nThe rise of fake news highlights an urgent need for a multidisciplinary scientific effort to study \\nmisinformation in the emergent news ecosystem of the 21st century.

Can we \\nempower individuals to detect and ignore it, through fact checking and education? What actions \\ncan platforms take to reduce its flow? Can fake news and social manipulations be algorithmically \\ndetected? How might industry collaborate with academics to identify answers to these questions?   \\nThis essay offers preliminary assessments of these foundational questions.   \\n \\nDEFINITION \\n \\nWe define fake news to be fabricated information that mimics the output of the news media in \\nform, but not in organizational process or intent. Most notably, fake news outlets lack the news \\nmedia’s editorial norms and processes for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of information. \\nFake news is a subcategory of misinformation—incorrect or misleading information about the \\nstate of the world. It is particularly pernicious in that it undermines the credibility of standard \\nnews outlets. We recognize that some have advocated eschewing the phrase because of its use as \\na political weapon. We have retained it both because of its value as a distinct scientific construct, \\nand because its political salience helps draw attention to an important subject.  Below, we offer \\nsome preliminary guideposts for converting this conceptual definition into an operational \\nresearch program. \\n \\nBACKGROUND \\n \\nThe ancien régime protecting against misinformation resulted from the emergence of journalistic \\nnorms of objectivity and balance that arose as a backlash among journalists against the \\nwidespread use of propaganda in World War I—particularly the role journalists had played in \\npropagating it—as well as against the rise of corporate public relations in the 1920s (for detailed \\nsupporting literature on this and other points, see SM). Local and national oligopolies created by \\nthe dominant technologies of information distribution in the 20th century (publishing and \\nbroadcasting) sustained these norms. The Internet has removed many of those constraints on \\ndissemination, contributing to the abandonment of traditional news sources that had long enjoyed \\nhigh levels of public trust and credibility. For instance, U.S. newspaper circulation fell 30% from \\n1990 to 2012 (1), while audience ratings for network television evening news programs \\nplummeted by 56% from 1980 to 2010 (2). In parallel, general trust in the mass media collapsed, \\nespecially on the political right. In 1997, 64% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans reported a \\ngreat deal or fair amount of trust in the media. Twenty years later, in 2016, these percentages had \\nfallen by 13 percentage points (to 51%) among Democrats, and by 27 points (to 14%) among \\nRepublicans (3).  \\n \\nThe United States has experienced an important evolution in its geo/socio/political environment \\nalongside these changes in the news ecosystem. Geographic polarization of partisan preferences \\nhas dramatically increased over the last 40 years (4-5), reducing opportunities for cross-cutting \\n \\n3 \\npolitical interaction. Homogenous social networks, in turn, reduce our tolerance for alternative \\npoints of view, amplify attitudinal polarization, boost our likelihood of accepting ideologically \\ncompatible news, and increase closure to new information.  \\n \\nWe believe these trends have created a context in which fake news can attract a mass audience. \\nBelow we discuss the social science and computer science research regarding belief in fake news \\nand the mechanisms by which it spreads. We focus particular attention on the many unanswered \\nscientific questions raised by the recent proliferation of politically-oriented fake news. \\n \\nPREVALENCE AND IMPACT \\n \\nHow large a problem is fake news? How common is it, and what impact does it have on \\nindividuals? There are surprisingly few scientific answers to these basic questions; and any \\nefforts devoted to possible solutions should be commensurate to the magnitude of the societal \\nproblem. In evaluating prevalence of fake news, we advocate focusing on publishers rather than \\nindividual stories, because we view the defining element of fake news to be the intent and \\nprocesses of the publisher. This has the additional advantage of avoiding the morass of \\nevaluating the “fakeness” of every single news story. \\n \\nOne study evaluating the dissemination of a set of prominent fake news stories estimated that the \\naverage American encountered between one and three fake news stories during the month before \\nthe election (6). This likely is a conservative estimate, since the study tracked only 156 fake \\nnews stories. We do know that, as with legitimate news, many fake news stories have gone viral \\non social media, suggesting that many people are exposed. However, knowing how many social \\nmedia accounts encountered or even shared a piece of fake news is not the same as knowing how \\nmany people read or were affected by it.  Metrics such as sharing and liking are subject to the \\nsame manipulations that enable fake news. For instance, the impact of a fake news story that has \\nbeen shared by millions of automated accounts but only a few humans is quite different from the \\nopposite. Despite recent tools to track the spread of fake news, the scientific capacity to measure \\nhuman attention to identified fake news content on the Internet is still limited, except in a lab \\nsetting (discussed below).  \\n \\nImportantly, exposure does not equal impact. Evaluation of the medium-to-long-run impact of \\nexposure to fake news on political behavior (e.g., whether and how to vote) is essentially \\nnonexistent in the literature. Beyond political impacts, what we know about media effects more \\ngenerally suggests many potential pathways of influence, from increasing cynicism and apathy to \\nencouraging extremism. There is, however, little evaluation of the impact of fake news in these \\nregards. The scientific community thus needs to develop collective resources for evaluating how \\nfake (and real) news exposure affects actual people, with known attributes and opinions. There \\n \\n4 \\nare some proprietary panels aimed at commercial markets devoted to studying people’s attention \\non the web; there need to be equivalent resources that are widely available for scientific research. \\n \\nINTERVENTIONS: EMPOWERING THE INDIVIDUAL, CHANGING THE STRUCTURE \\n \\nWhat interventions might be effective at stemming the flow of fake news? We identify two \\ncategories of interventions: (1) those aimed at empowering individuals to evaluate the fake news \\nthey encounter (in particular, fact checking and education); and (2) structural changes aimed at \\npreventing exposure of individuals to fake news in the first instance (i.e., changes in the policies \\nof the platforms). For present purposes, we focus on what we know and need to know regarding \\nthe effectiveness of potential interventions. \\n \\nEMPOWERING INDIVIDUALS \\n \\nCurrently, one of the primary interventions focused on stemming the flow of fake news is fact \\nchecking: the direct identification of content that is factually incorrect. There are many forms of \\nfact checking, from stand-alone websites that evaluate the factual claims of news reports, such as \\nPolitifact and Snopes, to evaluations of news reports by credible news media, such as the \\nWashington Post, to warnings on content placed by informational intermediaries, such as \\nFacebook. \\n \\nDespite the apparent elegance of fact checking, the science supporting its efficacy as a solution \\nto fake news is at best mixed. Research shows that people more often use the media for personal \\ngratification than for truth seeking.  Additional research demonstrates that people prefer \\ninformation that confirms their pre-existing attitudes (selective exposure) and view information \\nconsistent with their pre-existing beliefs as more persuasive than dissonant information \\n(confirmation bias). That is, prior partisan and ideological beliefs might prevent acceptance of \\nfact checking of a given fake news story. Ironically, this means that those most likely to be \\ndeceived by fake news are least likely to believe any attempt to prevent their own deception.  \\n \\nTo make matters worse, the way that human memory operates means that unless conducted \\ncarefully, fact checking might even be counterproductive under certain circumstances.  Research \\non fluency—the ease of information recall—and familiarity bias in politics shows that people \\ntend to remember information, or how they feel about it, while forgetting the context within \\nwhich they encountered it. They are also more likely to accept familiar information as true. Thus, \\nproviding any information may increase an individual’s likelihood of accepting it as true when \\nencountered again. The literature presents contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of \\nclaim repetition in fact checking. Experimental and survey research has confirmed the basic \\nfamiliarity effect, though recent experiments suggest that retractions are more effective in \\nreducing misinformation effects when they explicitly repeat the misinformation. Further research \\n \\n5 \\nis needed to reconcile these contradictions and determine the conditions under which fact \\nchecking interventions are most effective. \\n \\nA second, longer-run, approach seeks to improve individual evaluation of the quality of \\ninformation sources through education.  There has been a recent proliferation of efforts to inject \\ntraining of critical information skills in primary and secondary schools. However, we have found \\nno research on evaluating the causal impact of general training in critical information \\nconsumption skills on accurate assessments of news source credibility. Moreover, there is an \\nadditional risk that an emphasis on fake news might have the unintended consequence of \\nreducing the perceived credibility of real news outlets. Given the array of potential approaches, \\nand the possibility of undermining trust in news generally, there is a great need for a rigorous \\nprogram evaluation of different educational interventions. \\n \\nIn summary, the evidence that intervention at the individual level—through either fact checking \\nor teaching critical skills—will solve the problem of fake news is at best quite limited. This may \\nreflect broader tendencies in collective cognition, as well as structural changes in our society. \\nTypically, individuals evaluate the credibility of information they encounter only if it violates \\ntheir preconceptions or they are incentivized to do so. Otherwise, they tend to accept information \\nuncritically. People also tend to align their beliefs with the values of their community. \\nGeographic polarization along political lines can thus facilitate the emergence of self-reinforcing \\nalternative realities within a group. Policies of Internet platforms that rank order the delivery of \\ninformation according to people’s preferences may amplify the perception of political \\nhomogeneity among one’s peers. This set of issues points to the possibility of Internet platform-\\nbased interventions aimed at increasing the quality and diversity of the information that flows \\ninto a community.  \\n \\nPLATFORM-BASED DETECTION AND INTERVENTION: ALGORITHMS AND BOTS \\n \\nInternet platforms have become the most important enablers and primary conduits of fake news. \\nIt is, for instance, inexpensive to create a website that has the trappings of a professional news \\norganization. It has also been easy to monetize its content through online ads and social media \\ndissemination. The Internet not only provides a platform for publishing (mis)information, but is a \\nnetworked medium that actively promotes its dissemination.  \\n \\nAbout 44% of Americans overall report getting news from social media often or sometimes, with \\nFacebook as by far the dominant source (7). Social media are far more important than \\nmainstream media as conduits for fake news sites (6). Russia successfully manipulated all of the \\nmajor platforms during the 2016 election, as their recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary \\nCommittee made clear (8). Is it possible to rewire the Internet to reduce the spread and impact of \\nfake news? The point of intervention would be the big platform companies, most notably \\n \\n6 \\nGoogle, Facebook, and Twitter. They are often the mediators of not only our relationship with \\nthe news media, but also with our friends and relatives. Generally, their business model relies on \\nmonetizing attention through advertising. They use complex statistical models to predict and \\nmaximize engagement with content. For example, most Facebook users do not see all of the \\ncontent produced by their Facebook friends, but just the content with which Facebook predicts \\nthey are likely to engage.  \\n \\nIt is quite plausible that the emphasis by search and social media platforms on optimizing \\nattention from consumers increases selective exposure. Google or Facebook may provide users \\nwith slanted content because they predict that someone like them is more likely to engage with it. \\nThere is an emerging literature on the algorithmic underpinnings of the 21st century world, \\nincluding some evidence of this amplification of selective exposure of political content for \\nFacebook and Google. However, even though this research is fairly recent, it represents rapidly \\nfading snapshots of a moment in history. There exists little research focused specifically on fake \\nnews and no comprehensive data collection system to provide a dynamic understanding of how \\nthese pervasive systems are evolving. It is impossible to recreate the Google of 2010; Google \\nitself would be unable to do this even if they had a record of the underlying code, because the \\npatterns emerge from a complex interaction amongst code, content, and users. However, it is \\npossible to thoroughly capture for posterity what the Google of 2017 is doing. More generally, \\nresearchers need to conduct a rigorous ongoing audit of how the major platforms filter \\ninformation. \\n \\nThere is ample evidence that platforms are highly vulnerable to manipulation. By liking, sharing, \\nand searching for information, social bots (automated accounts impersonating humans) and \\nextreme partisans can amplify the reach of fake news. Bots are numerous and commoditized. \\nThey were responsible for a significant portion of political content posted during the 2016 \\ncampaign, and some of the same bots later attempted to influence the 2017 French election (9). \\nThese tactics also aim to manipulate the algorithms that platforms utilize to predict potential \\nengagement with content by a wider population. Indeed, a recent Facebook white paper reports \\nwidespread efforts to carry out this sort of manipulation during the 2016 election (10).  \\n \\nThe discussion above suggests various possible interventions by platforms. Consumers could be \\nprovided signals of source quality. Source quality could be incorporated into the algorithmic \\nrankings of content, and personalization of political information could be minimized relative to \\nother types of content. Functions that emphasize currently trending content could seek to exclude \\nbot activity from measures of what is trending. More generally, the automated spread of news \\ncontent by bots and cyborgs (humans aided by automated posting to their accounts) could be \\ncurbed. \\n \\n \\n7 \\nThe platforms have surely attempted each of these steps, in some form, and many others. They \\nhave posted statements about their efforts, as well as reports, such as Facebook’s aforementioned \\nwhite paper on information operations that claimed that manipulations by malicious actors \\naccounted for less than one tenth of 1% of civic content shared on the platform. However, these \\nand other such claims are unverifiable. Indeed, researchers, politicians, and the public should \\ndismiss as self-serving any claims that the platforms make regarding addressing the problem of \\nmisinformation that cannot be verified by third parties.  \\n \\nThis points to the value for platforms of collaborating with academics on evaluations of the \\nscope of the issue and the effectiveness of their interventions There are multiple challenges to \\nscientific collaboration, both from the perspective of industry and academics; however, these \\nbarriers have been tackled in other contexts. We thus believe these issues are surmountable, and \\nthat there is an ethical responsibility for the platforms to collaborate on the science of fake news.  \\n \\nThe possible effectiveness of platform-based policies suggests either self-regulation by the \\nplatforms or government intervention. Direct government regulation of an area as sensitive as \\nnews carries its own risks, such as, for instance, whether or not government regulators could \\nmaintain (and, as important, be seen as maintaining) impartiality in enforcing any content-based \\ndistinctions. An alternative to direct government regulation would be to enable tort lawsuits \\nalleging, for example, defamation.  To the extent an online platform assisted in the spreading of a \\nmanifestly false (but still persuasive) story, there might be avenues for liability, which in turn \\nwould pressure platforms to intervene more regularly. In the U.S. context, however, a provision \\nof the 1996 Communications Decency Act offers near-comprehensive immunity on this front to \\nplatforms for false or otherwise-actionable statements penned by others. Any change to this legal \\nregime, however, itself raises thorny issues about the extent to which platform content (and \\ncontent curation) should be subject to second-guessing by people alleging injury.  \\n \\nStructural interventions generally raise legitimate concerns about respecting human agency. But \\njust as the media oligopolies of the 20th century shaped the information to which Americans were \\nexposed, the far-more-vast Internet oligopolies are already shaping human experience on a \\nglobal scale. The question before us is how those immense powers are being—and should be—\\nexercised.  \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\nCurrent hand-wringing over fake news in many ways mirrors widespread concern in the mid-\\n20th century that propaganda—by Nazis, and later by Communists—posed a fundamental threat \\nto democracy. These concerns prompted the post-World War II generation of sociologists, \\npsychologists, and political scientists to pioneer the social-psychological school of political \\nbehavior research. Ironically, these scholars found little evidence of such a threat. Yet \\n \\n8 \\nsubsequent generations of scholars, building on these foundational works, have found that even \\nif the media (the presumed purveyors of propaganda) typically cannot change what we think \\n(that is, our attitudes), they are far more successful at changing what we think about (via \\npriming, framing, and agenda setting). The analogy to fake news is clear: even if fake news does \\nnot alter most people’s beliefs, it may nonetheless reinforce existing false beliefs, increase their \\nsalience, or shape the news agenda, with potentially harmful effects for society. Explicating and \\ncountering such effects requires a multidisciplinary research program similar to the post-World \\nWar II scholarly effort aimed at countering propaganda effects. \\n \\nOur call here is to promote interdisciplinary research spanning psychology, computer science, \\npolitical science, economics, law, and communication with the normative objective of reducing \\nthe spread of fake news and of addressing the underlying pathologies it has revealed.  The \\nfailures of the news in the early 20th century led to the rise of a set of journalistic norms and \\npractices that, while imperfect, generally served us well by striving to provide objective, credible \\ninformation. We must again redesign our news ecosystem in the 21st century. Doing so will \\nrequire new, multidisciplinary science on fake news and misinformation.  \\n \\n \\nReferences and Notes \\n1. R.
